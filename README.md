# JavaScript Calculator Project

I put my skills to the test in this project to create a simple calculator using just Vanilla JS. No additional libraries required. 

The project can be run in the browser

## Technologies used

HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, Figma (for the calculator design/layout)

### Known Issues

**Bugs**

 [x] Bug when starting with a decimal, there is no zero before the decimal place. E.g. 0.2 is appearing as .2

**TO DO**

 [ ] If the number input is greater than 10 digits it will break out of the display area. It should resize to fit.

 [ ] Allow multiple math operations. Currently you can only calculate two numbers. E.g (5 x 2 = 10) the calculator cannot handle more than this currently. I will change this.
